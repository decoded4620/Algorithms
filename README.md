# Algorithms
This project is a group of Algorithm Demonstrations that break down different implementations and their space/time/complexity.

## Running the demo
The `com.learning.java.Main` class is the entry point and main function. It can take a `1..N` arguments, denoting the class names of the algorithms to demonstrate. Each algorithm demonstration will run all implementations and print the results.

### Selecting an algorithm
The Algorithms are in the `com.learning.java.algorithmdemo.*` package.

Simply create a Run Configuration, using Oracle Open JDK 16, and provide input arguments of the fully qualified class names for the Algorithms you want to run.

## Notes
The code contains explanatory comments that discuss the differences in implementations.
